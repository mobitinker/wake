What Is This?
=============
Wake is a simple Android application that will awaken a phone at the
same time each day to make it be a wifi hotspot. The purpose is to allow
nearby sensors, attached to water purification systems or other equipment,
to upload their usage and maintenance data to a data collection host.
Of course other interesting uses are possible too. Emphasis is on low 
power consumption in remote areas without utilities.

Please contact me with ideas for further improvement. mobitinker at gmail.

Hats off to the heros at SWEETLab.org at Portland State University who
suggested the idea!

Instructions
============
Wake requires an Android device 2.2 or later that supports being a hotspot.

Wake runs at boot. If you don't want your phone being set in airplane mode 
most of the time, uninstall Wake or disable it. 

After install, the default setting is to be disabled. Use the settings to 
enable/disable and to set the daily wake time and duration. 
At appointed times, the program sets airplane mode off and turns the hotspot on.

If enabled and in test mode, Wake will turn on hotspot after two minutes and every five 
minutes thereafter. It will return to airplane mode after 60 seconds. This behavior 
occurs regardless of other settings and is purely for convenient testing.

The log will show start up and each wake and sleep event. The log shows the last
4kb of entries.

To conserve power, turn off vibrate, set screen timeout as low as possible plus any 
other settings recommended.
